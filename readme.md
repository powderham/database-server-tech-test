"Before your interview, write a program that runs a server that is accessible on http://localhost:4000/. When your server receives a request on http://localhost:4000/set?somekey=somevalue it should store the passed key and value in memory. When it receives a request on http://localhost:4000/get?key=somekey it should return the value stored at somekey.

If you finish, you can work on saving the data to a file."

Create a new git repository and write code to fulfill the brief to the best of your ability. Store the data in memory, not in a database, but bear in mind that you will later need to add a database to this code.

```
As a user,
So I can retrieve it at some other point,
I would like to store a key/value pair to a server
```

```
As a user,
So I can see what I have previously stored,
I would like retrieve a key/value pair from a server
```
